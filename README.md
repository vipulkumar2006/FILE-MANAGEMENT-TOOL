 #ABOUT THIS CODE#
 This is a basic file handling application written in C++ that allows the user to perform simple operations like writing, appending, and reading data from a file using standard file stream techniques. It is especially helpful for beginners who are learning how file I/O works in C++. The program is menu-driven and executes inside the terminal. On running, the user is shown a list of options: write new content, add content, view the file, or quit. If the user selects the write option, it opens a file named data.txt and overwrites any existing content with the new input given by the user. This is useful when someone wants to replace old data completely. If the append option is chosen, the program opens the same file in append mode and adds new content at the end, without affecting previous data. The third option reads and displays the contents of the file line-by-line, giving a clear view of what is stored. The fourth option is to safely exit the application. The program uses getline(cin, input) to take multi-word input, and the keyword "END" is used by the user to indicate when the input is complete. To handle common input issues, cin.ignore() is used after reading integer input to clear the buffer. The file handling is implemented using the standard <fstream> library with proper error checks to ensure the file is accessible before reading or writing. In case of any issue like file not opening or being inaccessible, a relevant message is shown to the user. The overall logic is simple, clear, and easy to modify for extended functionality. It is best suited for students working on file I/O assignments or small CLI-based utilities. This project was developed using the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, which is a lightweight and powerful code editor with syntax highlighting, terminal integration, and debugger support. With VS Code, you can write the C++ code in main.cpp, compile it using g++ main.cpp -o fileapp, and then run it from the integrated terminal by typing ./fileapp (or fileapp.exe on Windows). The editor also supports extensions like C/C++ IntelliSense which helps in autocompleting code and identifying syntax errors early. Using VS Code’s terminal makes it convenient to test user input without switching to an external console window. It also supports Git integration in case the project needs to be pushed to GitHub. The file created and modified by this program (data.txt) is automatically generated in the same directory as the executable. The code structure is modular with functions like overwriteFile, addToFile, and showFileContents that keep the logic separated and easy to understand. Since the program doesn’t rely on external libraries beyond the standard C++ headers, it is portable and can be compiled on most operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can expand this project by adding more features like deleting specific lines, searching content, or encrypting the file. This simple file manager serves as a foundation to build more advanced file-based applications in C++ and also helps in understanding how persistent storage works in console applications. Overall, this project combines practical usage of C++ file streams with a real-world implementation using the VS Code environment.
